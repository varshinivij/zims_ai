SpiderEnv — Gymnasium environment for the SpdrBot 4-arm / 12-servo robot.

URDF: SpdrBot_description_v2/urdf/SpdrBot.urdf
All 12 controlled joints are type="continuous" (no hard limits in URDF).
Software limits of ±JOINT_LIMIT rad are enforced by the env.

Elbow/wrist joint axes are diagonal (±0.707, ±0.707, 0) in the XY plane,
arising from the physical servo mounting angle in the CAD model.

Physical leg positions (shoulder servo XY in base frame):
  Leg 1 (Rev 77): rear  +Y  →  (-0.0752,  0.0301)
  Leg 2 (Rev 78): rear  −Y  →  (-0.0752, -0.0797)
  Leg 3 (Rev 79): front −Y  →  ( 0.0752, -0.0301)
  Leg 4 (Rev 80): front +Y  →  ( 0.0752,  0.0301)

Standing pose:
  STAND_ANGLES are currently set to zero (neutral / flat pose).

CPG gait (mirrored trot):
  Diagonal pair A (leg0=rear+Y, leg2=front-Y):  phase offset = 0
  Diagonal pair B (leg1=rear-Y, leg3=front+Y):  phase offset = π
  Explicit stance/swing separation (duty cycle = 0.65):
    Stance (65%): shoulder sweeps dir*(+AMP→-AMP), foot backward, elbow down.
    Swing  (35%): shoulder sweeps dir*(-AMP→+AMP), foot forward, elbow lifted.
  GAIT_SHOULDER_DIRS = [+1, -1, -1, +1]:
    +Y-side legs (0, 3): positive sweep = foot forward.
    -Y-side legs (1, 2): multiplied by -1 so foot also sweeps forward→backward.
    All four legs produce symmetric +X thrust; lateral forces cancel → no spin.
  RL action is treated as a residual correction on top of CPG targets.

Action  (12,) float32 — residual joint-angle offsets (rad), clipped to ±1.2
Obs    (377,) float32 — 360 LiDAR distances (m)  +  12 joint positions (rad)  +  5 IMU (roll, pitch, yaw_rate, cos_yaw, sin_yaw)

# Shoulder direction multiplier per leg.
#
# The shoulder servo rotates around the Z-axis.  Positive rotation sweeps the
# arm tip counterclockwise when viewed from above.  The foot sweep direction in
# X depends on which side the arm extends from the body:
#
#   +Y side (legs 0 and 3): arm points outward in +Y direction.
#          Positive shoulder → foot sweeps toward +X (forward).
#          So during stance (power stroke), sweep is +AMP → -AMP: correct.
#
#   -Y side (legs 1 and 2): arm points outward in -Y direction.
#          Positive shoulder → foot sweeps toward -X (backward — WRONG!).
#          Without correction, the stance stroke pushes the foot forward
#          instead of backward, producing a backward ground force → net torque.
#
# Multiplying by -1 for -Y legs inverts their shoulder sweep so every leg
# performs the same physical motion: foot starts forward, sweeps backward
# during stance, then lifts and recovers during swing.  Left/right forces
# now cancel laterally and sum in +X → forward motion without rotation.
# Signs are negated from the original geometric prediction because the URDF
# arm geometry means positive Z-rotation on +Y-side legs actually sweeps the
# foot toward -X (confirmed by running the sim).  Negating corrects this.

#                           = ~66 full gait cycles at 2.0 Hz
#
# Without substeps a 500-step episode was only ~2 seconds — far too short for
# the robot to move any meaningful distance before the episode ended.

FALL_ANGLE_RAD = 1.05    # ~60° in pitch or roll — robot considered fallen

# ── Reward weights ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Two priorities only:
#   1. Obstacle avoidance  (proximity + forward-danger + collision + avoidance)
#   2. Maximise +X         (forward displacement + progress shaping)
FORWARD_WEIGHT       = 8.0    # X-displacement reward per metre
SAFE_RADIUS          = 3.5    # m — warning zone for avoidance signal (raised from 3.0 to give more obstacle clearance margin)
OBSTACLE_WEIGHT      = 5.0    # mild background proximity signal — approach+danger carry the main weight
# Exponential steepness: penalty = (exp(EXP_K * closeness) - 1) / (exp(EXP_K) - 1)
# EXP_K=3.5 → more linear early gradient so the robot gets a clear "start evading" signal
# from the outer edge of the safe zone, not just the final approach.
EXP_K                = 3.5
# COLLISION_PENALTY must dominate the maximum possible accumulated episode reward.
COLLISION_PENALTY    = -10000.0
FALL_PENALTY         = -5.0   # terminal penalty for tipping over

# Lateral evasion reward — rewards velocity *away* from each hazard.
# Set high so active evasion (away_speed ≈ 0.2–0.3 m/s) is clearly net-positive
# compared to the proximity penalty alone, making "evade" visibly better than "freeze".
LATERAL_EVASION_WEIGHT = 10.0
# Extra penalty when the robot is heading directly into a hazard (heading-based).
FORWARD_DANGER_WEIGHT  = 8.0
# Approach velocity penalty — penalises actual velocity *toward* an obstacle.
# This is the primary signal against head-on charges; kept higher than FORWARD_DANGER.
APPROACH_WEIGHT        = 12.0
# Clear-path bonus — extra reward for +X velocity when nothing is directly ahead.
# forward_threat = max(closeness × forward_alignment) across all hazards in safe zone.
# bonus = max(0, vx) × (1 − forward_threat) × weight
# Full strength when the forward arc is empty; fades to 0 as an obstacle enters it.
CLEAR_PATH_WEIGHT      = 4.0
ALIGNMENT_WEIGHT       = 2.0   # reward for facing +X when forward path is clear

# Direct per-step reward for actively spinning toward +X while misaligned.
# reward = max(0, -sin(yaw) * yaw_rate) * (1-max_closeness) * weight
#   yaw > 0 (facing left)  → reward negative yaw_rate (turn clockwise = toward +X)
#   yaw < 0 (facing right) → reward positive yaw_rate (turn counter-clockwise = toward +X)
# Gated by (1-max_closeness) so it doesn't fight active obstacle evasion.
YAW_REALIGN_WEIGHT     = 4.0
# Penalise spinning *away* from +X (wrong spin direction) when path is clear.
# Complement of yaw_realign_reward: positive when sin(yaw)*yaw_rate > 0, i.e.
#   yaw > 0 (facing left)  and yaw_rate > 0 → spinning further left  (bad)
#   yaw < 0 (facing right) and yaw_rate < 0 → spinning further right (bad)
# This directly discourages the "always turn left" policy collapse.
WRONG_SPIN_WEIGHT      = 6.0

# Re-alignment penalties.
LATERAL_DRIFT_WEIGHT   = 4.0   # penalise |vy| — ungated so diagonal wall-drift is always costly
# Always-active heading error penalty — NO clearance gate.
# A gate would suppress this near walls, which is exactly when the robot must
# correct its heading fastest to avoid crashing into them.
YAW_CORRECTION_WEIGHT  = 5.0   # raised to make heading correction the dominant signal
BACKWARD_WEIGHT        = 15.0  # penalise negative world-X velocity — must dominate obstacle avoidance savings from U-turns

# Potential-based progress shaping toward the goal.
# Grounded in Ng et al. (1999): Φ(s) = GOAL_X − x, so the per-step shaping reward
# equals (GOAL_X − x_prev) − (GOAL_X − x_curr) = dx (only when x < GOAL_X).
# Equivalent to adding a second forward-weight that stops contributing once the
# goal is reached, giving a strong dense signal for every centimetre of progress.
GOAL_X           = 5.0     # m — target X coordinate (must match step() check)
PROGRESS_WEIGHT  = 15.0    # shaping reward per metre closer to goal (raised: primary goal-direction signal)
# Small per-step cost so the agent cannot avoid the goal-penalty of wandering.
# An efficient path (few steps, reaches goal) pays less total than a slow/wandering path.

# ── Residual action scale and smoothing ───────────────────────────────────────
# RESIDUAL_SCALE multiplies the agent's raw action before it is added to the
# CPG target.  It must be small enough that the CPG dominates.
#
#   CPG shoulder amplitude : ±0.55 rad  (range = 1.10 rad)
#   Max residual (raw)     : ±(1.2 × 0.15) = ±0.18 rad   ≈ 33% of CPG swing
#
# This ensures the CPG provides ≥67% of the control signal at all times, so
# random RL exploration cannot flip joint directions or override the gait.
RESIDUAL_SCALE = 0.15

# EMA weight applied to the residual each step before it reaches the joints.
# Acts as a first-order IIR low-pass filter: only ACTION_SMOOTH_ALPHA of the
# new action bleeds through per step; the rest carries over from the previous.
#   α = 0.55  →  ~1.5-step time constant  →  ~50 ms lag at 33 ms/step
# Increased from 0.3 so evasive lateral actions respond faster when near obstacles.
ACTION_SMOOTH_ALPHA = 0.55

# ── Wall planes for direct proximity computation ───────────────────────────────
# Replaces getClosestPoints() for walls to fix two bugs:
#   1. approach_speed and forward_alignment are zero for side walls when the
#      robot is walking straight — the closest-point normal is perpendicular to
#      velocity/heading so all active signals vanish, leaving only proximity.
#   2. getClosestPoints() returns unreliable normals at wall end-caps (corners),
#      corrupting approach/avoidance/danger signals near arena corners.
#
# Each entry: (perp_axis, inner_face_coord, repulsion_dir_2d)
#   perp_axis        — 0=X, 1=Y (the axis perpendicular to the wall face)
#   inner_face_coord — coordinate of the wall's inner face (robot-side surface)
#   repulsion_dir    — unit vector pointing FROM wall INTO arena interior
#
# Wall geometry from reset():
#   top wall    [2.5,  3.0, 0.5] half_extent Y=0.05 → inner face y= 2.95
#   bottom wall [2.5, -3.0, 0.5] half_extent Y=0.05 → inner face y=-2.95
#   back wall   [-1.0, 0.0, 0.5] half_extent X=0.05 → inner face x=-0.95
#   front wall  [ 6.0, 0.0, 0.5] half_extent X=0.05 → inner face x= 5.95
